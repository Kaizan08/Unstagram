# Unstagram

![screencap](screencap.png)

## Assignment

Your assignment is to remove the "Get a Photo!" button and replace it with infinite-scroll functionality. The app should load more images and append them to the bottom of the `timeline` when the user reaches the bottom of the page. You may modify the existing project in whatever way you see fit, however we do ask that you refrain from using any kind of infinite-scroll plugin.

Feel free to dress the page up with UX/UI improvements at your own discretionâ€“this is not required.
